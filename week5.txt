🎬 Final Movie Recommendations – Steps for This Week
We will now generate the final set of movie recommendations. Follow the steps below:

Create a CountVectorizer object
Use a word-based analyzer with bigrams (1–2 word sequences), and ignore rare words by setting a minimum document frequency.

Generate the Count Matrix
Transform the text data into a numerical count matrix. The shape should be approximately (2500, 6892) depending on the dataset.

Compute and Save the Cosine Similarity Matrix
Use the count matrix to calculate pairwise cosine similarity between movies. Save the resulting matrix to a CSV file.

Define a Recommendation Function
Create a function that takes a movie name as input and returns a list of recommended movies based on similarity scores.

Output Relevant Details
The output of the recommendation function should include the movie title, director, and release date for each recommended movie.

The example output for movie Avatar is given in week5.png
